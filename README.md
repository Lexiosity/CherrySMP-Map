# CherrySMP Maps
## What is CherrySMP Maps?
A. CherrySMP Maps is a website that allows you to view maps of every available season and see how much CherrySMP has improved over its existence.

## How was it done?
A. Thanks to an existing software, Unmined, I was able to render the maps from the server and generate a HTML with all the required files and add them to the repository so everyone can see the maps of the SMP.

## How often is it updated?
A. The current seasons will be updated monthly or every two months, depending on time and availability. The current seasons are updated not very often because so much happens in each season. All the previous seasons are updated to the most recent world download we have.

## Why are some of the seasons unavailable?
A. As it says, they were lost in the cloud, meaning that they aren't available due to corruption (caused by the addons we had in the early days). To fix the corruption, we decided to go full vanilla with a few custom-made addons.
